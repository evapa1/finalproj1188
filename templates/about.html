        <h1>About AI vs Coder</h1>
        
        <h2>What is AI vs Coder?</h2>
        <p>AI vs Coder is an interactive platform designed to help programmers improve their python coding skills by solving algorithmic challenges and comparing their solutions with AI-generated code.
            Motivated by GenEd 1188, this platform has a twofold purpose; first, I want it to teach students the impressive strides AI has made in the realm of coding. As part of our multifaceted look into
            the capabilities of AI, I wanted to express in a fun, game-oriented manner how efficient and quick AI could write code. At the same time, I also wanted to address concerns of how AI affects the workplace - 
            looking specifically at how AI will affect software engineering. Rather than taking a depressive, hopeless approach, through these practices, I aim to help people improve their skills (utimately using AI
            to leverage their abilities in getting jobs). In order to retain your progress, remember to save cookies and be on the same browser!
        </p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Our platform offers coding challenges across different difficulty levels and topics. You can write your solution, submit it for testing, and see how it compares to an AI solution in terms of correctness and efficiency.</p>
        
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Progressive Difficulty:</strong> Start with easy problems and work your way up to more challenging ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Challenges:</strong> A new hard problem every day to keep your skills sharp.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Attack Mode:</strong> Test your speed by solving as many problems as possible in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Visualize your performance with detailed analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Feedback:</strong> Get immediate results on your solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We believe that practice is the key to mastery in programming. Our mission is to provide a fun, engaging platform for programmers to sharpen their algorithmic thinking and coding skills.</p>
